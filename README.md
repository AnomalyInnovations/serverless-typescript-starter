- **Generating optimized Lambda packages with Webpack**
- **Using TypeScript in your handler functions and tests**
- **Run API Gateway locally**
  - Use `serverless offline start`
- **Support for unit tests**
  - Run `npm test` to run your tests
- **Sourcemaps for proper error messages**
  - Error message show the correct line numbers
  - Works in production with CloudWatch
- **Lint your code with ESLint**
- **Add environment variables for your stages**
- **No need to manage Webpack or Babel configs**

### Demo

A demo version of this service is hosted on AWS - [`https://ylsml6v6r6.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello`](https://ylsml6v6r6.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello)

And here is the TS source behind it

``` javascript
export async function hello(
  event: APIGatewayEvent,
  context: Context
): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResult> {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: "Go Serverless v2.0! Your function executed successfully!",
      context,
      event,
    }),
  };
}
```

### Requirements

- [Install the Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)
- [Configure your AWS CLI](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/)

### Installation

To create a new Serverless project.

``` bash
$ serverless install --url https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-typescript-starter --name my-project
```

Enter the new directory

``` bash
$ cd my-project
```

Install the npm packages

``` bash
$ npm install
```

### Usage

To run a function on your local

``` bash
$ serverless invoke local --function hello
```

To simulate API Gateway locally using [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline)

``` bash
$ serverless offline start
```

Deploy your project

``` bash
$ serverless deploy
```

Deploy a single function

``` bash
$ serverless deploy function --function hello
```

#### Running Tests

Run your tests using

``` bash
$ npm test
```

We use Jest to run our tests. You can read more about setting up your tests [here](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html#content).

#### Environment Variables

To add environment variables to your project

1. Rename `env.example` to `.env`.
2. Add environment variables for your local stage to `.env`.
3. Uncomment `environment:` block in the `serverless.yml` and reference the environment variable as `${env:MY_ENV_VAR}`. Where `MY_ENV_VAR` is added to your `.env` file.
4. Make sure to not commit your `.env`.

#### Linting

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to lint your code via [serverless-bundle](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-bundle).

You can turn this off by adding the following to your `serverless.yml`.

``` yaml
custom:
  bundle:
    linting: false
```

To [override the default config](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring), add a `.eslintrc.json` file. To ignore ESLint for specific files, add it to a `.eslintignore` file.
